# Source Inject

A source generator for C# that uses [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) (the C# compiler) to allow you to generate
your dependencies injection during compile time. By doing this
you avoid using reflection and services are automatically
registered.

## How to use it

Install it and add an attribute to the classes you want injected in your service provider, like so:

```csharp
[Inject]
public class ExampleService
{
    private readonly AnotherService anotherService;

    public ExampleService(AnotherService anotherService) =>
        this.anotherService = anotherService;

    public string GetValue() => anotherService.Value;
}

[Inject(ServiceLifetime.Singleton)]
public class AnotherService
{
    public string Value => "Hello World!";
}
```

As you can see above you can define the lifetime. The default lifetime is transient.
You can also use the following attributes:

- `InjectSingletonAttribute`
- `InjectScopedAttribute`
- `InjectTransientAttribute`

The last one is the same as using `Inject` without any arguments.

You then have to call the `Discover` method so these classes are found and the source is generated.
You can then require them using constructor injection or service locator, for example:

```csharp
var services = new ServiceCollection();
services.Discover();
var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
var exampleService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ExampleService>();
```

You can also discover services in other assemblies. To be able to do this you have to call
the method `DiscoverIn<AssemblyName>` or `<AssemblyName>Discoverer.Discover(services)`. If your
assembly name has dots `.` in them they will be replaced by underscore `_`.

All these methods (`Discover` et all) and attributes will be generated in your project for you.

You can see the generated code using Visual Studio. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/media/16.9/16.9_p3_source_generators_node.png) for an example.

## Installing
